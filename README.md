# MSGO Chat Traslator
MSGO translates the chat by reading the logs generated by the game then passed to Yandex for translation.

## Features
- Translates the Japanese chat into English!
- Uses LibCURL to access Yandex API

## Getting started
Prerequisites:
- Latest Windows 10 (All other versions are untested)
- Yandex API key (It is free! https://tech.yandex.com/translate/)

## Configurate

## Limitations
- Does not have common dictionary (Because I can't read Japanese)
- Yandex API is slow (but free!)
- Translations are not completely correct
